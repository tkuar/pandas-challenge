From the purchase data we have from the game Heroes of Pymoli, 
if we look as the gender demographics of the players, we can 
see that of the 576 players that made a purchase, players who
identify as males make up 84.03% of the players who made a purchase
while those who identify as female only make up 14.06% of the 
players who made a purchase, and the players who identify as other 
or chose not to disclose their gender only make up 1.91% of the
players who made a purchase. From the gender demographics of 
players based on the purchase data, we can conclude the majority
of players in Heroes of Pymoli identify as male. This conclusion
makes sense when looking at the purchasing analysis based on 
gender, and it shows that males have purchased the most items
from the game.

Looking at the purchase analysis by age, we can see that of all
780 purchases made, players in the 20-24 age group bought the most
items. In addition to be the age group that bought the most, the
20-24 age group that spent the most, which makes sense.

If we look at the most popular items and the most profitable items,
we see that the top 2 items in both data sets are the same. This
observation is not that surprising since it is logical to think
that the product that makes the most money is also the most
popular product.
